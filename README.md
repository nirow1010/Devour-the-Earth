*Devour the Earth* is a Space Invaders-inspired shooter built in Unity that focuses on persistent progression through failure. Players control disposable hivemind entities, assimilating enemy ships across runs to overwhelm an escalating planetary defense system gradually.

## Core Systems & Mechanics
In *Devour the Earth*, each run (invasion) is a single, expendable hivemind attempting to break through Earth's defenses. Individual entities are inherently weak, so failure is expected. The primary objective during an invasion is to damage the Earth by firing at it while surviving waves of defending ships. Earth's health is represented by a global HP bar.

### Assimilation
During each invasion, enemy ships, when destroyed, occasionally drop fragments, which can be collected and sent back to the hivemind base. These fragments are assimilated between invasions and converted into minions that persist across runs, as long as they are not destroyed.

Before each invasion, players can

## Technical Notes
