## Background Story

Far across the galaxy, the Earth has been discovered by a hivemind of space monster parasites. However, being a hivemind is not fun, as everything on their planet looks the same; they are tired of seeing and eating platinum every single day. Excitingly, they discovered that the Earth contains elements they had never seen before, and its core is composed primarily of nickel and iron. That must be tasty! So the aliens, ready to do anything to sate their boredom, set out on a journey across the galaxy to devour it. However, humanity’s advanced technology has alerted them to the incoming threat, so they rally around the planet to defend it. To reach the Earth’s core, the aliens must assimilate ships to grow their army and Devour The Earth!

When you press the Play button of the game, you'll enter the Hub, which is empty at the moment. Now, when you press the Attack button, located at the bottom right of the Hub, the invasion will begin. To devour the Earth, you must attack the Earth and lower its health, which is quantified at the bottom of the screen as the blue HP bar. You can move yourself with WASD, aim by moving the mouse, and fire a bullet with the left mouse click/hold.

However, you are a mere single hivemind entity, too weak to destroy the Earth that is firmly protected by its space force. Fortunately, you can use your hivemind assimilation ability to collect the enemy ship fragments, send them to the hivemind base, and assimilate them so that the next hivemind entity can use them. Every assimilated ship can be found in the Hub, where you can drag it to the radar-like space on the left part of the Hub to use it on the next invasion. Although you can assimilate as many ships as you want, they disappear from the Hub once destroyed.
